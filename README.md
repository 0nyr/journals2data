### TODOs

* [X] Understand how to read a CSV file and convert it to a dict/json object.
* [ ] Understand and fix module error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scraper.scraper'
* [X] Install Newpaper3k
* [ ] Test Newspaper3k with Elöd code.

## Objectif

Development of a deployable Python library allowing the use of online  scraping functions at regular intervals, through the use of pre-trained models.

##### Input: CSV or JSON config file

* URLs of journals to scrap
* Scraping frequency, interval durations
* Path for out files
* Language of journals, used to select the correct pre-trained model.

##### Output: JSON file containing articles

* URL of the journal
* URL of the article
* Timestamp of scaping
* (if available) date of publication of the article
* Title
* Full text

### Input

inside `conf/`, a JSON file with necessary info. The "journals" attribute is optional. If you prefer, use instead a csv file called `journals.csv` with first line of "URL" and a list of URLs in column below.

### Output

A big JSON file containing unique scraped articles with metadata and full text.

I have created the package architecture and implemented a way to get user-defined configurations. It works fine.

I have installed `Newpaper3k`, `unidecode` and tested the basic article full text scraper over a set of preselected URLs of articles. It seems to work fine, however, since I don't have access behind some paywalls, I can't scrap everything. I need more time to analyse the results of the test scraping process.

I have also tried to install WSL on windows but the installation is very slow and not finished yet. The DSI also made my account RDP ready for future remote use should I need to tweak stuff from the lab computer.

* I still do not have a wired connection for my laptop, hence cannot have an IPv6 and RDP on my main computer. Re-ask the DSI to do it.
* Continue to develop the Article scraper, and automate tests
* Analyse further the results of the scraping.
