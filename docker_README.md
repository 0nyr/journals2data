# Docker Build and Run

## Docker Build

Run the following command in the `python/journals2data` directory (where `Dockerfile` is located)

```shell
 sudo docker build -t scrapper . 
```

It may take a while. Make sure that the process ends with an output message such as : 
```shell
Successfully built d72eed7a2836
Successfully tagged scrapper:latest
```



## Docker Run

### Run Parameters

In order to avoid re-building the whole docker image each time we need to change the newspaper sources or the models,
the corresponding files are not built-in, we mount them when we run the docker container as follows

Just run your container as follows : 
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -i -t  \
--name scrapper \
--mount type=bind,source=<absolute_path_to_local_models-directory>,target=/models \
-v <absolute_path_to_local_newspaper_sources_csv_file>:/journals2data/src/journals2data/conf/csv/csv_docker_config.csv \
scrapper \
```

In this case :

* `--name` defines the name we give to the running container
* `--mount` allows to mount the model directory externaly, instead of building it into the image
* `-v` allows to mount the file containing newspaper sources , as follows
  * `-v <host_file_path>:/<container_file_path>`

Example : 
```bash
sudo docker run --rm -i -t  \
--name scrapper \
--mount type=bind,source=$HOME/PycharmProjects/journals2data/models/,target=/models \ 
-v $HOME/PycharmProjects/journals2data/csv_docker_config.csv:/journals2data/src/journals2data/conf/csv/csv_docker_config.csv \ 
scrapper \
```

### Run as a background task

To run the container as a background task, just add the `-d` flag to the previous docker run command.

To list the containers running, just run  :
```bash
sudo docker ps
```

You should see the container in the output

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
291b0213025e   scrapper   "conda run --no-captâ€¦"   12 seconds ago   Up 11 seconds             scrapper
```



If you want to attach to the running container in your terminal, just run :

```bash
docker attach --name scrapper
```

To detach from the container, press `CTRL+P` and `CTRL+Q`
